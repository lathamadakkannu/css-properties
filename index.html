			<p>A car or an automobile is a motor vehicle with wheels. 
				Most definitions of cars say that they run primarily on roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport people, not cargo.
				When the electrical current reaches the motor, they mesh together as the motor spins the engine. 
				As fuel and spark are introduced into the cylinders this is ignited, thus, the engine starts.

			<p>Cartoons are one of the efficient means that use colors to communicate something.
			In fact, colored moving images first capture children's attention before they understand any message, providing them with a world full of symbols that reflect complex concepts to explain to a young child.
			Cartoons are used today primarily for conveying political commentary and editorial opinion in newspapers and for social comedy and visual wit in magazines.</p>
